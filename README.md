**VETERINARY CLINIC DATABASE SYSTEM**

This repo contains sql code for a database of a veterinary clinic. The database contains tables such as:
i)pet table
ii)owner table
iii)staff table
iv) Prescription table
v) Medication table
vi) Treatment table
vii)Treatment-Medication table
viii) Billing table
ix) Appointment table
x) Insurance table
xi) Medical Records table.

The database emulates real world scenarios and bring forth various concepts and relations among the entities. The database also enforces referential integrity between the entities and no conflicts between existing entities.
The project is also very efficient and highly scalable due to the non comlexity and good relationships with minimal errors arising during testing.
